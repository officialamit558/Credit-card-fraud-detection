Process Work for Data Scientist

1) Take Dataset from kaggle using the opendatasets library
2) Wrangling or manuplating dataset and remove garbage feature
3) Normalization or Standardise tha value of each faeture between 0 to 1 using the StandardScale Library in python
4) Cheack the , Feature are produced the more accuracy and produced correct response
5) Import the Machine Learning Library such as
6) sklearn (From Sklearn import linear_model , LinearRegression , train_test_split , DecisionTreeClassification from sklearn.tree ,)
7) Fit our Model on 80% of training data and 20% for Test the model
8) Find the Confusion Matrix
9) In Confusion Matrix we find the Accuracy , Prediction
10) Finaly Import the model in form of  Pickle formate


Work for Software Engineers
Model Deployment are the More important for production in industries.

# For Deployment 
Tools Kit 
1) Used HTML , CSS and some JS
2) Used PAAS(Platform as a Service)  Like Heroku

# File Formate
1) Procfile
2) requirement.text
3) app.py
4) Model.pkl
5) ML.csv
